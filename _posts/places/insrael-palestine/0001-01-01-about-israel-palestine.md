I think I was sitting at the booth alone because I'd just ordered a fresh Fat Tire and needed a short break from the socializing that was happening over at the long tables in the dimly lit aft portion of the bar. On the fifth or sixth sip, Chris Wanstrath walked in. I have trouble remembering now if I'd even classify Chris and I as "friends" at the time. We knew each other through Ruby meetups and conferences, but only casually.

Like a mutual "hey, I think your code is awesome" kind of thing. I'm not sure what made me do it, but I gestured him over to the booth and said "dude, check this out." About a week earlier I'd started work on a project called "Grit":http://github.com/mojombo/grit that allowed me to access Git repositories in an object oriented manner via Ruby code.

Chris was one of only a handful of Rubyists at the time that was starting to become serious about Git.He sat down and I started showing him what I had. It wasn't much, but it was enough to see that it had sparked something in Chris.
